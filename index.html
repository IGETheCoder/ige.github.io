            <p>
                Hello there! I have a really strong passion for game development, like a burning flame to write code and watch it work. Nothing
                brings me more joy than working hard on a project and seeing my hard-earned result in action. I love this career path so much, I'm lucky
                I got into it. The story starts all the way back in 2017 when I was 6. I was invited to my brother's friend's house, where I met the
                person who got me into this. Being a kid, I was curious what he was doing, and then he opened my eyes to the world of programming, with
                Scratch. I thank you so much.
            </p>

                            <em>Train Trauma</em> is a surreal, linear-pathed game about PTSD, and was made in under a week.
                            You control your protagonist, <em>'Circle'</em>, as you explore your memories, learning about what happened to your friend.
                        <p>
                            <strong>
                                Losing your mind.
                            </strong>
                        </p>
                        It merges atmospheric narrative with the chaos of pure trauma. It's short, but it gets my message across.
